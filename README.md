## Overview

Extreme Blocks is a Tetris clone developed in my free time, with some features like realistic backgrounds, that belongs to cities like Roma, Milan, Torino, Venezia, and two different game modes.

The first mode goal is to beat all levels and reach to the biggest score possible, as the player defeat each level, the speed and the initial blocks are changing. And the second mode of gameplay it’s the practice mode, where you select how you wanna play, You select if the board have already blocks or not (if you select with blocks, they appear randomly), and you choose the speed with you want to play.
